## 2024-05-23 - [Textual Tooltips]
**Learning:** Textual widgets like `Button` support a `tooltip` property that displays a hint on hover, which is excellent for clarifying icon-only buttons or ambiguous actions in a TUI.
**Action:** When using buttons in Textual, especially for actions like "Apply" that have side effects (e.g., file writing), always add a tooltip to explain the specific outcome (e.g., "Save code to 'applied_code.py'").
